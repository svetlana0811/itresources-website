					<p>We get this question over and over again. There are, of course, different articles talking about the cons and pros of both Framework and CMS that help to choose which one suits you best, but here, we’ve decided to discuss this question from a different perspective. First of all we want to make sure that you as a customer understand the difference between the Framework and CMS (Content Management System) and get the answers of a list of questions like “What is the CMS?”, “Why should I make a selection?”, “Can’t I choose both?”, “Aren’t they the same?” and so on.
					When we use the term “Framework” it refers mostly to a software framework for a particular programming language. Programmers or web developers often choose a framework based on their favorite programming language as a backbone of the new project. Ideally one should choose the framework and programming language according to project needs.
					As to CMS, it’s more of a ready-to-use content management system and unlike framework doesn’t require any coding knowledge and almost everyone can handle a CMS. Most of CMS are very flexible and reasonably extendable, allowing programmers to write new modules and add new functionality to the existing system. Most of them allow complete freedom of styling, theming and modifying the front-end of your application. Most programmers choose to use CMS to accelerate the delivery of a project. It's worth to note that most of CMS are based on a specific software framework - either a common one for a given programming language or a custom, unique one explicitly created for this CMS. Nowadays there are a lot of debates and misunderstandings about what each of those above mentioned methods can offer. Some state that CMS gives every kind of possibility, others disagree and announce that only framework can give endless possibilities. But again, what should we choose?
